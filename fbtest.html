    <h1>Welcome to "The Big Game Changer" Facebook Page Chatbot Testing Instructions</h1>
    <p>Thank you for reviewing our application. We have designed our chatbot to assist users by providing immediate responses to their initial inquiries sent to our Facebook page, "The Big Game Changer". Here's how you can test our chatbot functionality:</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Initiate a New Conversation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please visit our Facebook page: <a href="#" target="_blank">The Big Game Changer</a>.</li>
        <li>To start the testing process, send a new message to our page. This can be a simple greeting or a question. Our chatbot is designed to respond to first-time messages, triggering the start of a new conversation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Important Note for Testing</h2>
    <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Our chatbot is configured to respond only to the initial messages of a conversation.</strong> This design choice is intentional to ensure that once a conversation has been established, any further communication can be managed directly by our team, allowing for personalized interaction.</p>
        <p><strong>If there is an existing conversation history between your testing account and "The Big Game Changer", the chatbot will not activate.</strong> This is to simulate the real-world use case where the bot assists with initial inquiries, and subsequent interactions are handled personally.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Expecting the Bot's Response</h2>
    <p>After sending your first message, you should receive an automated response from our chatbot. This response is crafted to provide helpful information or guide you to the next steps.</p>
    
    <p>Should you have any questions or require further assistance during your review, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
